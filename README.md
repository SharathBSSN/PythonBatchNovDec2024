This repository is developed to learn and understnd Python and its real-corporate level implementatins with the use of Git, GitHub and GitHub-Codespace.

## Git Commands

To make a clone of any given repo, ignore for codespace  [codespace allows to directly work on your given reposiory space]

    git clone <url>

To List all branches

    git branch

    git branch <branchName>  [Creates a new branch]

To switch to or check out into anothe branch

    git checkout <branchName>

    git checkout -b <branchName>  [Creates a new branch and checks it out to current working direcory]

To see modified files in local directory

    git status

To see changes made on file

To commit the changes

    git commit -m "commit message"

To push the commited changes

        Ex: Pushing changes from class01 -> mail
        git push origin class01

### Daily 

These are the list of instructions or recommended practices that allows one to be on page with repo, identifying any uncommited changes.

To check current working directory, bracnch

    git status

To check out to main branch

    git checkout main

To get the latest changes

    git pull origin main

To create new branch 

    git checkout -b <branchName>

## What I have learnt so far...
